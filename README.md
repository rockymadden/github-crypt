Takes advantage of the fact that GitHub makes users SSH public keys easily available
(e.g. [rockymadden](https://github.com/rockymadden.keys)). We can convert said public keys to PKCS8
pems to encrypt files. Encrypted files can then only be decrypted with the corresponding private
key.

#### Example Workflow:

* You execute `github-crypt encrypt` against a GitHub user's pubic key
* You send the encrypted file(s) to this user
* They execute `github-crypt decrypt`, using their private key to decrypt

#### Maximum Message Length:

Be aware, a maximum message length exists which depends upon the key size:

| Key Size (bits) | Maximum Message Length (bytes)
| --------------- | ------------------------------
| 768             | 85
| 1024            | 117
| 2048            | 246
| 4096            | 502
| 8192            | 1018

## Installation
```console
$ brew tap rockymadden/rockymadden
$ brew install github-crypt
```

## Usage

```console
$ github-crypt --help
Usage:
  github-crypt bits <username> [--index|-i <index>]
  github-crypt decrypt <file> [--key|-k <key>]
  github-crypt encrypt <file> <username> [--index|-i <index>]
  github-crypt keys <username> [--index|-i <index>]

Discovery Commands:
  bits     Output GitHub public key(s) bit-length
  keys     Output GitHub public key(s)

Crypto Commands:
  encrypt     Encrypt a file with a GitHub public key; only the corresponding private key can decrypt
  decrypt     Decrypt a file with the private key corresponding to the GitHub public key used to encrypt
```

> __PROTIP:__ All commands prompt for required arguments which were not provided via options or
arguments. This allows for both traditional usage and prompt-based usage.

### Encrypt file (as user `A`):
```console
$ github-crypt encrypt file.txt userb
Encrypting: done
```

### Decrypt file (as user `B`):
```console
$ github-crypt decrypt file.txt.enc
Decrypting: done
```
